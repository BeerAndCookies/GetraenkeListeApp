 Version 1:
 
 Barcode Scanner recognizes barcode, messy + huge amount of classes(some are unnecessary I suppose)-> must be cleaned;
 If student Card is brought nearby the phone, serial number is correctly recognized and shown on screen as Toast Message

 Version 2:
 Unneccesary/unused classes are deleted.(like QR Code scanner, since we dont use it) Barcode Scanner works.
